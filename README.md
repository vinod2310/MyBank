This is an Android app that is part of a prototype that I created to showcase transaction signing. The workflow of the full system is as follows
- Banking customer initiates a high value transaction
- They get notified on their online banking app about the transaction (from, to and dollar value of the transaction)
- They deny or allow the transaction
- A record of all activities are made on the back end system
